# Bachelor's Thesis - Energy-Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an **Energy-Aware Routing Protocol** aimed at improving the efficiency and longevity of **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)**. The proposed protocol aims to optimize energy consumption while maintaining the network's performance in dynamic environments, which is a critical aspect of WSNs, especially in IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

### Key Goals:
- **Design a novel energy-efficient routing protocol** that reduces battery consumption and increases the lifetime of wireless sensor nodes.
- **Simulate the protocol's performance** using **OMNeT++** to visualize energy consumption trends and network reliability.
- **Analyze the impact of the protocol** with results visualized using **MATLAB/Octave**.
- Utilize **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** for data storage and management during the simulation and performance analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **OMNeT++**: A discrete event simulation tool used for simulating network behavior and performance of WSN protocols.
- **MATLAB/Octave**: Used for **data analysis** and **visualization** of the simulation results to compare the energy consumption and protocol performance.
- **MySQL & PostgreSQL**: Database management systems used for storing and querying simulation data efficiently.
- **LaTeX (Overleaf)**: For writing the thesis and documenting the entire process and results.

## Project Structure:
- **src/**: Contains the **Java code** for implementing the energy-aware routing protocol.
- **db/**: Contains **SQL scripts** for setting up MySQL and PostgreSQL databases used during the simulation.
- **simulations/**: Contains simulation files for **OMNeT++**.
- **results/**: Includes output data and analysis results in the form of graphs and charts.
- **thesis/**: Contains the LaTeX document of the thesis, including the written report, methodology, results, and conclusions.

5. **Conclusion**: Final thoughts and proposed future work.

## How to Run the Simulation:
1. **Set up OMNeT++** on your system by following the installation instructions in the [OMNeT++ Documentation](https://omnetpp.org/doc/).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the **simulations/** folder and import the OMNeT++ project files.
4. Configure the simulation parameters as per the thesis.
5. Run the simulations and view the results.

## Results:
The results of the simulation can be found in the **results/** folder, where you will find graphs comparing the performance of different routing protocols with respect to energy consumption and network lifetime.

## Conclusion:
This thesis presents a promising approach to reducing energy consumption in **Wireless Sensor Networks** by designing an energy-aware routing protocol. The results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves network longevity, making it suitable for real-world applications in fields such as environmental monitoring and smart cities.
